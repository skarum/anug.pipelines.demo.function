# Azure DevOps Pipelines demo: Nuget package

This repository contains a simple function consuming a Nuget package from a Azure DevOps feed and build script for creating the function artifact.

Build file is: `/CI/azure-pipelines.yml`

In the demo the release pipeline created the resources in Azure and published the code to a simple function.
